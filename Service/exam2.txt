It was planned as a much-needed northern route for the town. - [1] - . The efficiency of the project was directly attributable to two RWC451 cranes, manufactured by Ronsonworks, a company based in England.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align:justify\"\u003eThe two identical tower cranes were owned by the construction firm Redding Builders. One crane was assembled at the south bank of the river, while the other one was placed on a concrete pylon in the center of the Stonewell River. - [2] - . The assembly of the second crane was particularly challenging, as it required the use of another crane on a floating barge.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align:justify\"\u003e\"Any large project is going to require\u0026nbsp;unforeseen adjustments that may disrupt an official construction schedule,\" said Roger Lee, chief engineer of Redding Builders. - [3] - . In this case, the metal anchors that connected the bridge to the pylons were determined to be too small. The new anchors weighed 22 tons, which is within the safe lifting capacity of an RWC451 crane. - [4] - . Engineers reinforced the existing cranes for extra security, and the cranes performed well.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align:justify\"\u003eToday, this postcard-worthy bridge is the pride of Stonewell, featuring viewing platforms for pedestrians, hikers, and visitors at the base of each pier overlooking the mountainous valley. Construction materials and colors harmonize beautifully with the local environment. All design elements, including the piers, viewing platforms, and railings, complement the natural landscape, making the bridge a hit with everyone from hikers to the truck drivers who now include it in their regular route.\u003c/p\u003e \n"},{"partId":7,"questions":[{"correctAnswer":0,"partId":5,"question":"176.
